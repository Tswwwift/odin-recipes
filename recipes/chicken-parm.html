    <p>Impress your family with this quick chicken Parm recipe. It's an easy Italian dinner made with Progresso Recipe Starters fire-roasted tomato cooking sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup Progresso® Italian style panko crispy bread crumbs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, flattened slightly</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) can Progresso™ Recipe Starters™ fire roasted tomato cooking sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a large zip-top bag. Shake each chicken breast in the bag to coat; transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until browned, 6 to 10 minutes, turning once. Pour tomato cooking sauce around chicken, then sprinkle remaining bread crumb mixture and mozzarella cheese over top; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken and sauce over spaghetti.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Panko bread crumbs are crisper than dried bread crumbs and can be found in the same section of your grocery store. Give them a try!</p>
    <p>In place of shredded mozzarella, you can use four 1-ounce slices.</p>
